# Sorting algorithms
Cython implementation of some sorting algorithms. The overall goal is to compare execution time of the algorithms

First create a virtual enviroment:

```
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 env
```

Then install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally for testing the algorithms run the main file:

```
python main.py
```
